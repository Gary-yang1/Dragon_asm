// Package casbin's seed wires the MVP role→permission matrix into an enforcer.
//
// The platform uses project-scoped roles stored on project_member.role (one of
// the six role constants below). A user's role in a project grants that role's
// permission set for that project; project access itself is gated separately by
// the project access boundary (project.Service.Authorize). The matrix is seeded
// as Casbin policies with the global domain ("*"), so a role's capabilities are
// uniform across projects — what varies per project is whether the user holds
// the role there.
//
// This is the MVP default matrix, derived from design §2.1 (role
// responsibilities) and §2.3 (permission points). It is intentionally conservative
// and documented so it can be reviewed and adjusted as policy; it is NOT a
// secret and NOT a credential. Persisting policies to the DB adapter (M0-3) and
// syncing user→role groupings from project_member is tracked separately.

// mvpRolePerms is the MVP role→permission matrix. Each role maps to the set of
// permission points it grants, in every project (domain "*").
//
// Rationale (per design §2.1):
//   - system_admin: platform owner — every permission point, including
//     project:access so it can reach any project without a project_member row.
//   - security_admin: cross-project security management — everything except
//     platform-config administration (admin:manage), including project:access.
//   - project_owner: owns a project's assets/risk/tickets — full asset + risk +
//     ticket + scope + report-read within the project; no cross-project export,
//     audit read, or platform admin. Enters via membership, so no project:access.
//   - security_ops: day-to-day operations — asset read/write, discovery, risk
//     confirm, ticket dispatch, report read; no deletion, no accept/suppress,
//     no approval, no export. Enters via membership.
//   - developer: remediation — read-mostly plus ticket write to submit
//     remediation; no asset writes, no risk mutation. Enters via membership.
//   - viewer: read-only across asset/discovery/risk/ticket/report. Enters via
//     membership.
//
// project:access is seeded only for the two cross-project admin roles; the
// project-scoped roles are granted project entry by their project_member row,
// not by the matrix.
